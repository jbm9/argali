# Because we run the docker with the userid of whoever's running the
# command, they (usually) don't have an account inside the docker
# container.  This results in a prompt like
#
#  I have no name!@23424f1a23c:/code$
#
# Which is distracting and feels broken.  Instead of that, let's just
# give ourselves a nice clean prompt and a history file.

# It's not possible to actually include this cleanly in the Ubuntu
# /etc/bash.bashrc (which I think is behavior inherited from the
# debian one), so we just pull in the key parts from the system
# bashrc, update the helper script that launches interactive bash in
# docker to use this as bashrc, and call it a day.

# "$?]" here puts the exit status of the last command in your prompt.
